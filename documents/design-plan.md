# Project 4 - Design & Plan

Your Team Name: [your team name]

## Milestone 1, Part II: Client Selection

### Client Description

Global Health Student Advisory Board

"something simple as who we are, a section where we could post information about our events, promote our programs and then a section that we could use to post applications for our case completion, post submissions for our symposium and maybe a platform for applications to join our group"


[NOTE: If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site. Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the final project requirements.]

## Milestone 1, Part III: Client Requirements

### Target Audience(s)

Cornell students that are interested in engaging with the global health program.

### Purpose & Content

Pictures of the team, contact, calendar of events with description, tab with an application for Global Case Competition which emails to the host.

### Needs and Wants

[Collect your client's and target audience's needs and wants for the website. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Memo** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.]

Administrator updates.
(possibly in Spanish)

Blog thingy

Example:
* Needs/Wants #1
  * **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
    * Client wants to cater to people who speak different languages.
  * **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
    * Create web-pages manually in multiple languages.
    * Use google translate to auto-translate the site on the fly.
  * **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
    * Creating multiple pages manually would require manual skills, effort and time that we do not have.
    * Using auto-translate using Google-Translate API is an easier way to go. Plus, we would like to learn the Google Translate API.

### Hosting Plan

[What is your plan for hosting your client's website?]
Cornell webhosting service
### Client's Edits

[Does the client need the ability to edit the site after the end of the semester? If **Yes**, tell us how you site fit your client's need. If **No**, write down N/A.]

Yes
updates and blog
### Information Architecture, Content, and Navigation

[Lay out the plan for how you'll organize the site and which content will go where. Note any content (e.g., text, image) that you need to make/get from the client.]

[Note: As with the Needs and Wants table, there is no specific amount to write here. You simply need enough content to do the job.]

Example:
* Content #1
  * **Main Navigation** (List your site's navigation here.)
    * Portfolio
  * **Sub-Categories** (List any sub-categories of under the main navigation.)
    * Websites
    * Mobile Apps
    * Tablets
  * **Content** (List all the content corresponding to main navigation and sub-categories.)
    * *Portfolio*: list all the projects (as images) this client has worked on. When the image is hovered over, display a description of the project; add a search function to enable users search for specific projects;
    * *Websites*: showcase all the websites designed by the client, with thumbnail images and a brief description for each design;
    * *Mobile Apps*: showcase all the mobile apps designed by the client, with thumbnail images and a brief description for each design;
    * *Tablets*: showcase all the tablet applications designed by the client, with thumbnail images and a brief description for each design;

### Interactivity

[What interactive features will your site have? What PHP elements will you include?]

[Much of this is up to you, however, implementing a login system is **required**. Logging in should not be required to view the site, however it must unlock extra functionality, e.g., admin functionality, comment posting, etc.]

[Also, describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.]

### External Code

[What libraries (e.g. editor.js, jQuery Cookie, Image Sliders, jQuery) are you planning to use for the site? What do you have to do to incorporate those libraries? How much of your own code will satisfy the project requirements?]

### Scale

[How large will the site be (approximate number of pages) and how many hours of work will be required to complete it?]

## Milestone 1, Part IV: Work Distribution

[Describe how each of your responsibilities will be distributed among your group members.]

[Set internal deadlines. Determine your internal dependencies. Whose task needs to be completed first in order for another person's task to be relevant? Be specific in your task descriptions so that everyone knows what needs to be done and can track the progress effectively. Consider how much time will be needed to review and integrate each other's work. Most of all, make sure that tasks are balanced across the team.]

## Milestone 1, Part V: Additional Comments

[If you feel like you haven't fully explained your design choices, or if you want to explain some other functions in your site (such as special design decisions that might not meet the final project requirements), you can use this space to justify your design choices or ask other questions about the project and process.]



## Milestone 2, Part I: PHP Interactivity

[Describe here what you plan to do for your PHP Interactivity requirement.]

## Milestone 2, Part II: Sketches, Navigation & Wireframes

### Sketches

[Insert your sketches here.]

### Navigation

[What will be your top-level pages and your sub-pages for those top-level pages? What will your website's navigational structure?]

[Tip: If you use card sorting for your navigation, show us that work by including a picture!]

Example:
* Products (top-level)
  * Shoes (sub-page)
  * Pants
  * Shirts
* Shopping Cart
* Contact

### Wireframes

[Insert your wireframes here.]

## Milestone 2, Part III: Evaluate your Design

[Use the GenderMag method to evaluate your wireframes.]

[Pick a persona that you believe will help you address the gender bias within your design.]

I've selected **[Abby/Patricia/Patrick/Tim]** as my persona.

I've selected my persona because... [Tell us why you picked your persona in 1-3 sentences. Your explanation should include why your persona will help you address gender-inclusiveness bugs in your design.]

### Tasks

[You will need to evaluate at least 3 tasks (known as scenarios in the GenderMag literature). List your tasks here. These tasks are the same as the task you learned in INFO/CS 1300.]

[For each task, list the ideal set of actions that you would like your users to take when working towards the task.]

Task 1: [describe your task]

  1. [action 1...]
  2. [action 2...]
  3. ...

Task 2:

Task 3:

### Cognitive Walkthrough

[Perform a cognitive walkthrough using the GenderMag method for all of your Tasks. Use the GenderMag template in the <documents/gendermag-template.md> file.]

#### Task 1 - Cognitive Walkthrough

[copy the GenderMag template here and conduct a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate your design (wireframes).]

[You may need to add additional subgoals and/or actions for each task.]

#### Task 2 - Cognitive Walkthrough


#### Task 3 - Cognitive Walkthrough


### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How did you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be very thorough and thoughtful.]

## Milestone 2, Part IV: Database Plan

### Database Schema

[Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.]

Table: movies
* field 1: description...
* field...

### Database Queries

[Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]

## Milestone 2, Part V: Structure and Pseudocode

### Structure

[List the PHP files you will have. You will probably want to do this with a bulleted list.]

* index.php - main page.
* includes/init.php - stuff that useful for every web page.
* TODO

### Pseudocode

[For each PHP file, plan out your pseudocode. You probably want a subheading for each file.]

#### index.php

```
Pseudocode for index.php...

include init.php

TODO
```

#### includes/init.php

```
messages = array to store messages for user (you may remove this)

// DB helper functions (you do not need to write this out since they are provided.)

db = connect to db

...

```

## Milestone 2, Part VI: Additional Comments

[Add any additional comments you have here.]


## Milestone 3: Updates

[If you make any changes to your plan or design, make a list of the changes here.]


## Milestone 4: Updates

[If you make any changes to your plan or design based on your peers' feedback, make a list of the changes here.]


## Milestone 5: Cognitive Walkthrough

[Copy your tasks here from Milestone 2. Update them if you need to and then conduct another cognitive walkthrough.]

### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How did you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be very thorough and thoughtful.]

## Milestone 5: Final Notes to the Clients

[Describe in some detail what the client will do (or would have to do) in order to make this website go live. What is the deployment plan?]

[Include any other information that your client needs to know about your final website design. For example, what client wants or needs were unable to be realized in your final product? Why were you unable to meet those wants/needs?]

## Milestone 5: Final Notes to the Graders

[1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.]

[2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.]

[3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.]
